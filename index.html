<p>Hey this is my portion of the our teams page and I will leave some 
    information for my teammates can get to know me a bit more based on
    my favorite hobby, which is gaming. But gaming refers to so many
    different genres that people can not really get an understanding from
    simply that message. So what I decided to do is make a table to show
    some of the genres of games I enjoy and the game I most enjoy in each
    genre.
</p>

<h4>Game Table</h4>

<p>In addition to enjoying video games I have been able to transfer my passion for 
    it, and contribut to the Husky Game Club here on campus from the very start of
    my time here at UWB in 2019. As of now I am the club president and wish to keep
    on helping the club be a community for anyone that enjoys games regardless of 
    genre interest. So there are a few things I am happy with, but still have things
    I wish to develop in the club.
</p>

<div><strong>Things I am happy with:</strong></div>

<ul>
    <li>Club sturcture</li>
    <li>Members of the club</li>
    <li>Weekly events with other clubs</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Things I wish to improve based on priority:</strong></div>
<ol>
    <li>Have a way for people with interests in single player games to express themselves</li>
    <li>Have collaborations with other clubs, due to the BWiSE collaborations being fun to be a part of.</li>
    <li>For when in person classes come back have balance of in person and remote events for people to partcipate in.</li> 
</ol>
